    <h1>used for heading and it goes from h1 to h6 </h1>
    
    <h2>this goes in descendig order</h2>

    <h1>highest</h1> and <h6>smallest</h6>
  
    this are known as elements, Which are used for heading.

    Difference between html tags and elements???

    Elements always comes with starting tags and ends with closing tag.

    Tags are used only once like when it start and close in between only one argument is passed while in case of 
    elements we can use it as a nested elements also. Multiple tags can be used inside it.
